# Piscine Python for Data Science - 42

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the **Python for Data Science Piscine** at 42.

The piscine is an intensive, progressive program designed to build strong Python foundations before moving into data-oriented concepts such as data manipulation, object-oriented programming, and structured data processing.

## Piscine Structure

The piscine is composed of several mandatory modules, to be completed **in order**:

- **Python - 0 - Starting**  
  Python basics, syntax, functions, scripts, and coding standards

- **Python - 1 - Array**  
  Data structures and array manipulation

- **Python - 2 - DataTable**  
  Working with structured and tabular data

- **Python - 3 - OOP**  
  Object-oriented programming in Python

- **Python - 4 - Dod**  
  Data-oriented design and advanced concepts

## Goals
- Build solid Python fundamentals
- Learn to write clean, structured, and robust code
- Prepare for advanced Data Science modules

---

## Notes
- Python version: **3.10**
- All projects follow 42 coding standards
- Work is organized by module and exercise
